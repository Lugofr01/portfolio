                        <p class="lead">
                            <br />Hello! My name is Frank Charles Lugola, and I am a Computer Science graduate from Luther College with a minor in History. My time at Luther College has provided me with valuable opportunities to work with various technological skills, enabling me to develop reliable software that is relevant to modern society.
                            <br/>
                            
                            <br/>Through my Computer Science curriculum, I have gained proficiency in Full Stack, Front-End, Back-End, Security, and Network Engineering. These skills were reinforced through intensive projects that challenged me to apply these concepts in real-life situations.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>I have a diverse knowledge base, with experience in programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and SQL. Recently, I have also delved into Scheme and functional programming. In addition, I have familiarized myself with frameworks such as React, React Native, and Vue for frontend development. Currently, I am expanding my skills in front-end development with Next.js. For back-end development, I am proficient in Flask, Django, and Node.js, enabling me to create full-stack applications.
                            <br/>
                        
                            <br/>In the field of History, my studies have allowed me to understand the historical connections between various cultures and communities worldwide. 
                            I have delved into East Asian history, South Asian history, African history, environmental history, and the reformations during Renaissance Europe.
                            
                            <br/> I have also explored the Classics, diving into the history of Ancient Greece and Rome, and engaging with the works and tragedies of renowned tragedians such as Aeschylus. These explorations have deepened my curiosity about ancient societies. Additionally, I have delved into the practices of ancient physicians in Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome, as well as their views on astronomy and their theories regarding the composition of the universe.<br />

                     <h5>Trivial Routing Protocol </h5>
                     <p class="lead">  I implemented a distributed vector routing protocol that facilitated collaboration among routers and efficiently handled multiple connections asynchronously. Each router in the network maintained a set of neighboring routers, along with a routing table dictionary adhering to the format "{ destination: [cost, next_hop] }". 
                        This project was developed using Python and executed on the Ubuntu platform. 
                        The protocol's objective was to optimize routing decisions by dynamically updating the routing table based on information exchanged among routers.

                     <h5> Daytime Protocol </h5>
                     <p class="lead"> 
                        During the Fall of 2022, I worked on a project to implement client-server communication using the Daytime protocol (RFC 867). This protocol enables clients to retrieve the current date and time from a server.

                        For this project, I developed both a TCP and UDP server that could respond to client requests with the current date and time for a specified location. To achieve this, I utilized the 'net' module for the TCP server and the 'dgram' module for the UDP server.
                        These modules allowed me to handle client connections and messages efficiently. I utilized the 'getTime' function that I had defined to provide the necessary information to clients.

                        The implementation served as a concise demonstration of utilizing Node.js to develop server functionality and communicate with clients using different protocols. This project provided me with valuable experience in working with server-side development and utilizing various protocols.

                        On the client-side, I implemented the Daytime protocol using Python. I developed a script that allows me to connect to a server and retrieve the current date and time. The script supports both TCP and UDP protocols, giving me the flexibility to choose the communication method with the server.

                        For the TCP implementation, I used the socket module and established a TCP connection with the specified server and port. After connecting, I received the server's response containing the current date and time, which I then printed to the console.

                        Similarly, in the UDP implementation, I used the socket module with the SOCK_DGRAM parameter, indicating a UDP socket. I sent a UDP message to the server, received the response, and printed the obtained date and time to the console.

                        To enhance the versatility of the client script, I incorporated command-line argument parsing using the argparse module. This allowed me to specify the desired protocol (TCP or UDP) when running the script.

                        The project showcased my skills in server-side development using Node.js and client-side implementation using Python, with an emphasis on working with TCP and UDP protocols.

                        <p class="lead"> As a board member of the Luther Black Student Union, my primary responsibility was managing social media and providing updates on plans and events organized by the Luther BSU. 
                            This allowed me to extend my activism and raise awareness about racial injustices faced by the black community in the United States. 
                            I also practiced intersectionality by highlighting injustices against other minority groups.
                            The Luther BSU platform served as a tool to combat mistreatment of minorities
                            . Being part of the executive board, I regularly interacted with the black community through organized meetings,
                             where I took part and  facilitated discussions on Thursdays.
